# gitmojima 😊

**gitmojima** is a [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/)-like set, aimed at minimalism and productivity.

> **When Less is More: minimalism and beyond**
>
> The essence of Japanese aesthetic is a concept called **Ma** 間 — the pure, and indeed essential,
void between all things. A total lack of clutter, *Ma* is like a holder within which things can
exist, stand out and have meaning.

## Purpose

[gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) is a loosely visual implementation of [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/),
a specification for adding human and machine readable meaning to commit messages.

The current set of gitmoji however stands at 73 items already, with more being added over time.
This high number of available emojis allows for finer granularity, but it is intimidating to make
efficient use of and also causes cognitive hindrance that makes commit history harder to navigate.

**gitmojima** is an attempt to select only a very minimal number of emojis while still
covering most use cases for enhanced productivity.
